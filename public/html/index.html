       Gus is the cat at the theater door
        His name, as I ought to have told you before
        Is really Asparagus, but that's such a fuss to pronounce
        That we usually call him just <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cat+song+lyrics&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwj7w7CWgcHUAhUJyWMKHSVIB50Q_AUIBygC&biw=1280&bih=590#tbm=isch&q=gus+the+cat&imgrc=ly25jfEPcqSsCM:">Gus</a>.

        His coat's very shabby, he's thin as a rake
        And he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake
        But he was in his youth quite the smartest of cats
        But no longer a terror to mice or to rats

        For he isn't the cat that he was in his prime
        Though his name was quite famous, he says, in his time
        And whenever he joins his friends at their club
        Which takes place at the back of the neighboring pub

        He loves to regale them, if someone else pays
        With anecdotes drawn from his palmiest days
        For he once was a star of the highest degree
        He has acted with Irving, he's acted with Tree

        And he likes to relate his success on the halls
        Where the gallery once gave him seven cat calls
        But his greatest creation as he loves to tell
        Was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell

        I have played in my time every possible part
        And I used to know seventy speeches by heart
        I'd extemporize back chat, I knew how to gag
        And I knew how to let the cat out of the bag

        I knew how to act with my back and my tail
        With an hour of rehearsal, I never could fail
        I'd a voice that would soften the hardest of hearts
        Whether I took love lead or in character parts

        I have sat by the bedside of poor little Nell
        When the curfew was rung then I swung on the bell
        In the pantomime season, I never fell flat
        And I once understudied Dick Whittington's cat
        But my grandest creation, as history will tell
        Was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell

        Then, if someone will give him a toothful of gin
        He will tell how he once played a part in East Lynne
        At a Shakespeare performance he once walked on pat
        When some actor suggested the need for a cat

        And I say now these kittens, they do not get trained
        As we did in the days when Victoria reigned
        They never get drilled in a regular troupe
        And they think, they are smart just to jump through a hoop

        And he says as he scratches himself with his claws
        Well the theater is certainly not what is was
        These modern productions are all very well
        But there's nothing to equal from what I hear tell
        That moment of mystery when I made history
        As Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell

        I once crossed the stage on the telegraph wire
        To rescue a child when a house was on fire
        And I think that I still can much better than most
        Produce blood curdling noises to bring on the ghost
        And I once played Growltiger could do it again
        Could do it again, could do it again
